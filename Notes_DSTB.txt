 Data Scientist's Toolbox This is an introduction to the tools and ideas that you will see throughout the rest 
 of the Data Science track. 
 
The key word in Data Science is "science". 

Focus: 
(1) an introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and 
reproducible insight, 
(2) an introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data 
in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and 
(3) on giving you plenty of hands on practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself. 

Getting you set up with the appropriate tools and accounts you will need for the rest of the track and on giving you 
a solid grounding in the key conceptual ideas. 
The material is basic.
